# Skin Disease Classification using EfficientNet

This project leverages the EfficientNet pre-trained model to classify skin diseases based on medical images. The application aims to provide accurate predictions by using transfer learning on the EfficientNet architecture, fine-tuned for skin disease classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify various types of skin diseases from images using a deep learning model. We utilize EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN), which is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for this specific medical task.

EfficientNet provides better accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional CNN architectures, making it ideal for deployment in real-world healthcare applications.
